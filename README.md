# Vicsek-Model-Simulation
**Vicsek Model Simulation**   An interactive JavaScript-based simulation demonstrating collective behavior in particle systems. Adjust parameters like speed, noise, and interaction radius in real time. Includes play/pause and restart controls to explore swarming dynamics. Inspired by the Vicsek model, with detailed concepts.
